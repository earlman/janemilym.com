In the heart of Baltimore, Jan Emily, a Ph.D. student at John Hopkins, was on the brink of a breakthrough. The ARCADE lab buzzed with energy.

With a background in Biomedical Engineering, Jan had always been fascinated by the intersection of tech and biology. The lab was her playground.

Her latest project? A robotic system that could perform echocardiogram procedures with unparalleled precision. The idea stemmed from her M.S. thesis.

But this wasn't just any robot. It was designed with end effectors Jan had 3D-printed, compatible with the advanced KUKA robot software.

One evening, as the sun set over the city, Jan received an email from the Filipino Googler Network. An invitation to a tech summit in Silicon Valley.
