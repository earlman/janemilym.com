I am currently a PhD student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) in the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Dr. Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and medical imaging, towards developing computationally intelligent and collaborative clinical systems. My current work is focused on 3D visualization for advanced navigation in sinus surgery. In 2022, I completed a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/science-and-engineering/academics/biomedical-engineering/index.php) advised by [Dr. Andrew Hall](https://www.slu.edu/science-and-engineering/academics/biomedical-engineering/faculty/hall-andrew.php).

In my free time, I like to crochet, paint, and hang out with my cat, Miso üê±
