I am currently a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University in the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Dr. Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and medical imaging, towards developing computationally intelligent and collaborative clinical systems. In 2022, I completed a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Saint Louis University advised by [Dr. Andrew Hall](https://www.slu.edu/science-and-engineering/academics/biomedical-engineering/faculty/hall-andrew.php). 

In my free time, I like to crochet, paint, and hang out with my cat, Miso üê±
