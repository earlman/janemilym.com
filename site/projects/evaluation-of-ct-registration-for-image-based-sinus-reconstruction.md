The project aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of sinus reconstruction surgeries by exploring advanced image registration techniques. Specifically, the focus is on the evaluation of different computed tomography (CT) registration methods for aligning dense reconstruction and CT images to guide endoscopic navigation.
