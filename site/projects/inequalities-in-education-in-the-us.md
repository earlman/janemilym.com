Education is one of the most important human rights. It enables people to communicate effectively, discern right from wrong, and develop skills essential for survival. Yet, education quality heavily depends on economic status, race, gender, and location. For example, in Mexico, “eighty percent of indigenous children at the end of primary school don’t achieve basic levels in reading and math, scoring below the average for primary school students”. Additionally, in Haiti, 17% of 19-year-olds are still in primary school due to late enrollment. Educational inequality seems to be present regardless of the country’s economic standing. In the United States, for example, there is a pronounced difference in accessibility to quality education based on the concentration of race, economic status, and gender within a region.
